Need to create 4 card boxes using BootStrap in the first row.


Each player will have the following variables:
HP, Counter-Attack, Attack

So in total we'd need 12 variables, 3 for each player.

The second Row will have the Attack button.

When a player selects a character, the remaining cards(enemies) move to a row below the main character. We need an onClick function for this to happen.
Once the players are positioned, the onClick function should not work again. So we set the state of the game here to start.


Now when the player clicks on an enemy, another row is created as a child element with the selected enemy css card.

The attack button will now appear. So we need to also place a buttom element the row above the defender.
When the player clicks attack, the defender looses HP, which will be dislayed on the health bar beneath the picture card.
Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power. Example with base 6 attack, 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on).


Once this is trigerred, the opponent will automatically use the counter attack and the player will loose HP as well.


The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.

The enemy character only has Counter Attack Power.
Unlike the player's Attack Points, Counter Attack Power never changes.
The Health Points, Attack Power and Counter Attack Power of each character must differ.


When the defender's HP is reduced to zero or below, remove the enemy from the defender area. The player character can now choose a new opponent.
The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game the game if their character's HP falls to zero or below.
